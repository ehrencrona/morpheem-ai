		The most effective form of teaching is one-on-one tutoring. Traditional language learning apps
		canâ€™t replicate this experience. However, with the advent of Large Language Models (LLMs), this
		can change.
	</p>
	<p class="my-4">
		Morpheem is an experiment in applying LLMs to language learning. It offers endless example
		sentences, open-ended writing exercises, and personalized feedback.
	</p>
	<p class="my-4">
		Morpheem is a lean-forward experience, not for killing time on the subway. It is very much a
		work in progress, but for serious learners, it can already be a uniquely useful tool in their
		learning journey.

	<p class="my-4">
		This is a non-commercial project. There is no cost associated with it, and your feedback is
		crucial for future development. Welcome!
